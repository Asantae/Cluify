# Cluify Case Seeding Philosophy

This document outlines the principles and definitions used when creating new cases for Cluify. Following these guidelines ensures a consistent and enjoyable experience for players.

## Case Components

Each case is built from a collection of people, reports, and evidence. The goal is to create a compelling mystery that is challenging but fair.

### Suspect Archetypes

Every person involved in a case falls into one of three categories:

*   **Guilty:** This is the person who actually committed the crime. All of the "telling" evidence will point directly to them. Their story should be consistent with the core facts of the case, even if they attempt to lie or mislead.

*   **Red Herring:** This is a suspect who appears guilty but is innocent. They may have a motive, weak evidence pointing towards them, or behave suspiciously. Their purpose is to challenge the player's deduction skills and force them to look more closely at the evidence. A well-designed red herring makes a case more interesting and less predictable.

*   **Noise:** These are other individuals connected to the case who are clearly not the perpetrator. They might be witnesses, acquaintances of the victim, or people mentioned in passing. Their reports and associated evidence serve to build the world of the case and can provide context, but they are not meant to be serious suspects.

### Case Difficulty

The difficulty of a case is determined by several factors, which are balanced to create the desired level of challenge.

*   **Easy:**
    *   Fewer suspects (e.g., 3-4 total).
    *   Telling evidence for the guilty party is very clear and direct.
    *   The red herring is not very convincing.
    *   Fewer reports and pieces of evidence overall.

*   **Medium:**
    *   A moderate number of suspects (e.g., 5-6 total).
    *   Evidence against the guilty party requires some interpretation or connecting multiple pieces of information.
    *   The red herring is plausible and may have compelling, though ultimately misleading, evidence against them.
    *   A larger volume of reports and evidence to sift through.

*   **Hard:**
    *   A large number of suspects (e.g., 7-8+).
    *   The telling evidence is highly circumstantial or requires putting together many small, seemingly unrelated clues.
    *   Multiple convincing red herrings.
    *   A significant amount of noise and distracting information.

## Creating Case 0: "The Silent Nanny" (Easy)

This case will be our template for an easy-difficulty case.

*   **Crime:** A wealthy philanthropist is found dead in his home office.
*   **Autopsy:** The cause of death is poisoning.
*   **Suspects (8 total):**
    *   1 Guilty Party
    *   1 Red Herring
    *   6 Noise
*   **Next Steps:** We will define the case description and then create the reports and evidence for each suspect.
